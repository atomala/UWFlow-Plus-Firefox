## <a name="functions"></a>Functions
This extension works as a page script on pages on the [ugradcalendar domain](http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca). When the user hovers over a course, the extension creates a hovering frame which fetches information from [UWFlow](https://uwflow.com) about the given course. There is also a right-click option added to these links for convenience which opens the corresponding UWFlow page in a new tab.
## <a name="installation"></a>Installation
Download the xpi file in the bin folder and then open it in Firefox.
